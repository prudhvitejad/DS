Two Pointers - Used to solve problems involving arrays/linked list specially where you need to find pairs/triplets that satisfy certain conditions.

Sliding Window - Used for problems involving subarrays/substrings when you need to find the max/min or a specific condition within a fixed-size window.

Fast & Slow Pointers - Used for problems related to finding cycles in linked list or arrays.

Merge Intervals - Used for problems involving patterns such as merging overlapping intervals.

Backtracking - Used for problems involving permutations/combinations and other scenarios where you need to explore all possible configurations.
